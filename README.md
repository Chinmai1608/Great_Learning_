Data Science Project 
## Terro's Real Estate Agency

This project is around a real estate agency. Assume, you have been hired at a Terroâ€™s Real Estate Agency in the capacity of an Auditor. One of the jobs that the auditors of this agency do is to map all the relevant features for the properties along with the information related to the geography around it. The agency wants to understand the relevance of the parameters that they collect in relation to the value of the house.

### Questions Addressed:

1. The first step to any project is understanding the data. So for this step, generate the summary statistics for each of the variables. What do you observe?
	
2. Plot the histogram of the Avg_Price Variable. What do you infer?
	
3. Compute the covariance matrix. Share your observations.
	
4. Create a correlation matrix of all the variables as shown in the Videos and various case studies. State top 3 positively correlated pairs and top 3 negatively correlated pairs.
	
5. Build an initial regression model with AVG_PRICE as the y or the Dependent variable and LSTAT as the Independent variable. Generate the residual plot too. a. What do you infer from the Regression Summary Output in terms of variance explained, coefficient value, Intercept and the Residual plot? b. Is LSTAT variable significant for the analysis based on your model?
	
6. Build another instance of the Regression model but this time include LSTAT and AVG_ROOM together as Independent variables and AVG_PRICE as the dependent variable. a. Write the Regression equation. If a new house in this locality has 7 rooms (on an average) and has a value of 20 for L-STAT, then what will be the value of AVG_PRICE? How does it compare to the company quoting a value of 30000 USD for this locality? Is the company Overcharging/ Undercharging? b. Is the performance of this model better than the previous model you built in Question 5? Compare in terms of adjusted R-square. Explain.
	
7. Now, build a Regression model with all variables. AVG_PRICE shall be the Dependent Variable. Interpret the output in terms of adjusted R-square, coefficient and Intercept values, Significance of variables with respect to AVG_price. Explain.
	
8. Pick out only the significant variables from the previous question. Make another instance of the Regression model using only the significant variables you just picked. (HINT: Significant variables are those whose p-values are less than 0.05. If the p-value is greater than 0.05 then it is insignificant) Answer the questions below: a. Interpret the output of this model. b. Compare the adjusted R-square value of this model with the model in the previous question, which model performs better according to the value of adjusted R-square? c. Sort the values of the Coefficients in ascending order. What will happen to the average price if value of NOX is more in a locality in this town? d. Write the regression equation from this model.

# Master Data Analytics in SQL & Excel

Course Description:

Data analytics requires you to effectively transform data into actionable information. This course will walk you through the statistical and EDA concepts through excel. You will use SQL to extract business information from relational databases and use that data to define business dimensions, store transactions about customers, produce results, and more. You will also learn about Data Wrangling, Statistics using Excel, Linear regression, and RDBMS.
